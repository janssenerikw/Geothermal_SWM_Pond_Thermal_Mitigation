    "## Introduction\n",
    "This Jupyter notebook is a companion to the paper titled \"Thermal Mitigation of Stormwater Management Pond Outflows Using Geothermal Cooling\" submitted to the Journal of Water Management Modeling. It provides a Python function that numerically solves the analytical geothermal system model. Different functions would be required depending on the variable being solved for. The function provided below solves for the pond outflow temperature downstream of the geothermal cooling system (T<sub>p2</sub> in the paper). "
